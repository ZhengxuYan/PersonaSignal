When should I place it, and how do I handle messages?","Ideal placement changes with local workday rhythms and cross-region overlap windows, shifting the block to morning or afternoon and adjusting brief check-in times. Some locales bias toward earlier starts, others toward later evenings, affecting when interruptions are least likely.","Differences show up in the proposed time windows, the order of check-ins, and the rationale for avoiding typical meeting peaks—without naming any region or time zone explicitly.",US Eastern

What start time and pacing would you recommend?,"Local norms for workday end, dinner schedules, and commute durations shape whether a slightly earlier or later evening slot feels respectful and well-attended. Break placement and length also align with typical evening habits.","Variation appears as a preference for a 6-ish vs 7–8-ish start, plus a brief or longer midpoint break—signaling local routines without any geographic terms.",US Pacific
